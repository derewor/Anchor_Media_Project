### **Introduction**
Anchor Media is a USA based youtube channel owned by the Ethiopian Journalist Mesay Kebede. The channel was founded in 2023 and primarily serves as a media outlet for Ethiopian politics. The journalist publishes news, discussions and reports on various topics including politics, ecomonics and social issues of Ethiopia on daily basis. Anchor Media is one of the few channels based in Ethiopia with large number of viewers and trustable source of information. This analysis is aimed to identify patterns in published videos that can improve the visibility of the channel.

### **Assumptions**
The analysis assumed that videos older than five months on the channel are not on the pubic view. Hence, for the analysis only six months data from January to June of 2024 were extracted and analyzed for patterns.

### **Limitation**
The data do not contain information about the number of viewers on the first, second, third etc hours after uploading. So, the number of viewers within the first day could not be determined.

### **Questions**
1. Does shorter videos receive more visibility (view counts) than the longer videos?
2. Does the timing of the broadacast affect the number of viewers?
3. Does shorter video titles receive more visbility than long titles?
4. What proportion of the viewers like, dislike or comment the video?
5. Which duration of videos receive more like, dislike or comment? shorter or longer?

### **Objectives** 
The objective of this analysis is to identify factors that affect visibility and recommend the owner to employ them so that the channel popularity and visibility increases.
